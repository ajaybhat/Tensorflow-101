## Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Python

### Installing Conda
Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. You can find the installers and installation instructions at <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads" target="_blank" data-unsp-sanitized="clean">https://www.continuum.io/downloads</a>
If you already have Python installed on your computer, this won't break anything. Instead, the default Python used by your scripts and programs will be the one that comes with Anaconda. Choose the Python 3.5 version. After installation, youâ€™re automatically in the default conda environment with all packages installed which you can see below. You can check out your own install by entering <code> conda list </code>

From your terminal, type: 
<code> conda upgrade conda </code>
<code> conda upgrade --all </code>

### Jupyter Notebooks
The Jupyter notebook is a web application that allows you to combine explanatory text, math equations, code, and visualizations all in one easily sharable document. 

By far the easiest way to install Jupyter is with Anaconda. Jupyter notebooks automatically come with the distribution. You'll be able to use notebooks from the default environment.

To install Jupyter notebooks in a conda environment, use <code> conda install jupyter notebook </code>.

Jupyter notebooks are also available through pip with <code> pip install jupyter notebook </code>.
To open Jupyter notebook, Run the following from the root directory of your repository to open up a notebook:
<code>jupyter notebook</code>

### Installing dependencies

<code> conda install --yes --file requirements.txt</code>
